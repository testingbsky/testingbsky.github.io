# 10X Social App 

This is a fork of the [Bluesky Social app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app).

The fork is hosted on GitHub Pages and available here: [https://chrisjacob.github.io/10xsocial](https://chrisjacob.github.io/10xsocial)

Fork this repository to easily setup your own personal Bluesky app (for FREE! ...plus no local developer environment required).

**Simple 10 Step Setup:**
1. Create an account on GithHub, login and go to [https://github.com/chrisjacob/10xsocial](https://github.com/chrisjacob/10xsocial) (you are here)
2. Click on the "Fork" button, the "Create a fork" modal will pop up, now click "Create fork" (the default values are fine)
3. Now on your forked repository page (e.g. https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/10xsocial) click on the "Actions" tab
4. Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them" (the workflows are safe)
5. Click on the "Code" tab, scroll down to the "README" and click on the "Pencil" (Edit file) button 
6. Make a minor edit to the README file (e.g. add a space character), then click the "Commit changes..." button, then "Commit changes" button (the default values are fine)
7. Click on the "Actions" tab, you should see 4 skipped workflows (Grey icon), and 3 workflows "In progress" (Yellow icon)
8. Wait about 6 minutes for the "Build and Deploy Github Pages" workflow to complete successfully (Green icon)
9. Click on the "Settings" tab, then the "Pages" sub-menu. Update fields to: Source = "Deploy from a branch", Branch = "gh-pages", Folder = "/ (root)", then click the "Save" button
10. Wait a minute then refresh the page... you should see "Your site is live at https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/10xsocial/" (go take a look!)

When you go to your app you'll see a "Page not found" page, you can simply ignore this and click "Sign In".

If you setup a Custom Domain the "Page not found" issue goes away... e.g. [https://10x.social](https://10x.social)

**Setup a Custom Domain:**
If you get stuck, please [read the docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), Google it, or ask ChatGPT.

1. Register a domain name e.g. "my-awesome-app.com" via a domain registrar e.g. https://www.namecheap.com
2. In GitHub, click on the "Settings" tab, then the "Pages" sub-menu. 
3. Under the "Custom domain" section enter your domain e.g. "my-awesome-app.com" and click "Save"
4. Setup your DNS: [Configure an apex domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) and [Configure the www subdomain variant](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
5. [Verifying your custom domain for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages)

# Bluesky Social App

Welcome friends! This is the codebase for the Bluesky Social app.

Get the app itself:

- **Web: [bsky.app](https://bsky.app)**
- **iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199)**
- **Android: [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app)**

## Development Resources

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) application, written in the TypeScript programming language. It builds on the `atproto` TypeScript packages (like [`@atproto/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/api)), code for which is also open source, but in [a different git repository](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto).

There is a small amount of Go language source code (in `./bskyweb/`), for a web service that returns the React Native Web application.

The [Build Instructions](./docs/build.md) are a good place to get started with the app itself.

The Authenticated Transfer Protocol ("AT Protocol" or "atproto") is a decentralized social media protocol. You don't *need* to understand AT Protocol to work with this application, but it can help. Learn more at:

- [Overview and Guides](https://atproto.com/guides/overview)
- [Github Discussions](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions) üëà Great place to ask questions
- [Protocol Specifications](https://atproto.com/specs/atp)
- [Blogpost on self-authenticating data structures](https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol)

The Bluesky Social application encompasses a set of schemas and APIs built in the overall AT Protocol framework. The namespace for these "Lexicons" is `app.bsky.*`.

## Are you a developer interested in building on atproto?

Bluesky is an open social network built on the AT Protocol, a flexible technology that will never lock developers out of the ecosystems that they help build. With atproto, third-party integration can be as seamless as first-party through custom feeds, federated services, clients, and more.
